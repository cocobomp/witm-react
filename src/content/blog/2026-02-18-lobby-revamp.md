# The Lobby Just Got a Major Glow-Up

We've completely reworked the lobby experience in WITM, and we think you're going to love it. More room for your crew, more control over your game, and a cleaner look overall. Let's dive in!

## Redesigned Lobby Layout

The lobby now features a responsive grid that shows up to **6 player cards** (3 rows x 2 columns), giving everyone the spotlight they deserve. The PIN display has been made more compact with a handy **share button** right next to it, so inviting friends is faster than ever. The whole layout feels more spacious and polished. ✨

## Game Settings Panel

Here's the big one — hosts can now **customize the game** before starting! Tap the settings icon in the lobby to open the new Game Settings panel. From there, you can tweak:

- **Category** — pick which category to play
- **Number of questions** — choose between 3, 5, 10, 15, or 20
- **Timer duration** — set the voting timer to 5, 10, 15, 20, or 30 seconds
- **Self-vote** — allow or prevent players from voting for themselves
- **Anonymous mode** — hide who voted for whom 🕵️

Not the host? No worries — non-host players can see the current settings in **read-only mode**, so everyone knows what to expect before the game starts.

## Smarter Performance

Previously, questions were reloaded every time the host changed a setting. That's gone. Now, questions are **loaded only when the game actually starts**, cutting down unnecessary network calls and making everything snappier. 🚀

## Category Display During the Game

Small but meaningful: the **category name** is now displayed during gameplay, so you always know what theme you're playing. No more "wait, what category was this again?" moments.

## What's Next

We're always cooking up new ways to make your game nights better. Got ideas? Let us know — your feedback shapes WITM!
