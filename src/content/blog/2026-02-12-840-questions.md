# 840 Questions to Spice Up Your Next Party

We've been hard at work curating the ultimate question bank for **Who Is The Most?** — and today we're thrilled to announce that the game now packs **840 hand-picked questions** across all 7 categories.

## What Changed

### More Questions, Better Balance

Every category now has exactly **120 questions**:

| Category | What to Expect |
|----------|----------------|
| **WTF !?** | Absurd, chaotic, "would-they-really?" energy |
| **Friends** | The ones that expose who's *really* the glue of the group |
| **Family** | From wholesome to "grandma just left the chat" |
| **Job** | Corporate nightmares, side-hustle dreams, office politics |
| **Hot** | Flirting disasters, ex drama, and relationship red flags |
| **Normal** | Everyday habits that are more revealing than you'd think |
| **Problemes** | The hard-hitters — politics, manipulation, moral dilemmas |

### Less Fluff, More Fire

We went through every single question and removed the boring ones. No more "Who is most likely to eat cereal?" — sorry, that's not a conversation starter.

What stayed (and what we added):

- **Subversive questions** that spark real debate between friends
- **Political & moral dilemmas** that force you to think (and point fingers)
- **Spicy relationship questions** that will make couples nervous
- **Dark humor** that keeps the energy up without crossing the line

### Quality Over Quantity

We didn't just add questions — we pruned hard. Over 50 weak or duplicate questions were removed across multiple rounds of review. Every question in the game right now was hand-picked to be:

1. **Fun to answer** — it should make the group laugh or argue
2. **Revealing** — it should spark a reaction, not a shrug
3. **Universal** — anyone in the group should be a potential answer

## Some of Our Favorites

Here's a taste of what's waiting for you:

- *"Who is most likely to become a tyrant if given power?"*
- *"Who is most likely to join a cult without realizing it?"*
- *"Who is most likely to kiss a stranger at a party?"*
- *"Who is most likely to sacrifice their principles for money?"*
- *"Who is most likely to talk to ChatGPT more than their actual friends?"*
- *"Who is most likely to get banned from a WhatsApp group?"*

## Available in 3 Languages

Every question is available in **English**, **French**, and **German** — so you can play with friends from anywhere.
