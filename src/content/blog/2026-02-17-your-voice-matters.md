# Your Voice Matters — Help Us Build the Game You Deserve

**Who Is The Most?** didn't appear overnight. It's the result of years of work — late nights, countless iterations, and a genuine love for bringing people together through laughter and awkward revelations.

But here's the thing: **we can't do this alone.**

## Why Your Feedback Is Everything

We're not a big studio with focus groups and massive budgets. We're a small team building something we believe in, and the people who matter most to us are the ones actually playing the game — **you**.

Every piece of constructive feedback we receive gets read, discussed, and taken seriously. Whether it's a feature suggestion, a bug report, or just a "this question made my whole group lose it" — **it all counts**.

Here's what your feedback has already helped us do:

- Rewrite over **50 weak questions** and replace them with better ones
- Improve game stability and fix synchronization bugs
- Add new categories based on what players actually wanted
- Optimize the experience for smoother, faster gameplay

**None of that would have happened without you.**

## How You Can Help

You don't need to be a developer or a designer to make a difference. Here are the simplest ways to support the project:

### 1. Leave a Review

A rating on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6740487737) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qelp.qelp_quiz) goes a long way. It helps new players discover the game and tells us what we're doing right (or wrong).

### 2. Share With Friends

The game is literally built to be played with others. Send it to your group chat, bring it to your next party, challenge your coworkers. The more players, the more fun — and the more motivation we have to keep building.

### 3. Tell Us What You Think

Got an idea? Something that annoys you? A question you'd love to see in the game? **We want to hear it.** Reach out through the app, on social media, or drop us a message — every suggestion is welcome.

## A Project That Grows With You

**Who Is The Most?** is not a finished product collecting dust. It's a living project that evolves with every update, every new question, and every player who joins.

But a project like this can only truly flourish with a community behind it. We're not asking for much — just a little support, a little sharing, and honest feedback when something could be better.

**You're not just playing a game. You're shaping it.**

Thank you for being part of this journey. The best is yet to come.
