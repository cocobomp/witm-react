# Website Update: Faster, Smarter, Mobile-First

We've been working hard to improve the WITM website, and today we're happy to share the results!

## What's New

### Mobile-First Navigation

The entire mobile experience has been redesigned. The navigation menu is now a clean, full-screen overlay with large touch targets and smooth animations. No more awkward side panels — just a beautiful, centered menu that works perfectly on any phone.

### Performance Boost

We've optimized how the website loads:

- **68% smaller initial bundle** — the main JavaScript file went from 825KB to 266KB thanks to smart code splitting.
- **Lazy loading images** — photos and screenshots only load when you scroll to them, saving bandwidth.
- **1-year cache** on static assets — returning visitors get instant loads.
- **Brotli compression + HTTP/3** enabled through Cloudflare.

### SEO & Discoverability

- Full **sitemap** with multi-language support (English, French, German) and hreflang tags.
- **Structured data** (JSON-LD) so Google better understands our content.
- Proper **Open Graph** and **Twitter Card** meta tags for beautiful link previews.

### Cloudflare Integration

We've moved our DNS and security to **Cloudflare**, bringing:

- **Global CDN** — the site is served from the closest data center to you.
- **DDoS protection** and managed WAF.
- **HSTS** and security headers for a safer browsing experience.
- **Early Hints + 0-RTT** for faster TLS connections.

## What's Next

We're continuing to improve both the app and the website. Stay tuned for new game features, more blog content, and exciting updates!
